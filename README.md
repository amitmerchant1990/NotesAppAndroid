NotesAppAndroid
===============

Take notes on the GO. :blush:

- An application through which I'm trying to learn some of(if not most) the aspects of Android application developement. I'll try to learn most out of it.

Things I've used so far
=======================
* ListViews
* SQLite Database Handler
* Context Menu
* CRUD Operations
* PendingIntents, AlarmManager and Notification classes to implement reminders
* Date and Time spinners

Further improvements

* ~~Copy to clipboard feature~~
* ~~Update Note feature~~
* Delete multiple Notes at a time
* Creating a splash screen
* ~~Updating alarm manager~~
* Creating preference screen
