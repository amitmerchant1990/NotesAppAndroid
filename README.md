NotesAppAndroid
===============

Take notes on the GO. :blush:

- An application through which I'm trying to learn some of(if not most) the aspects of Android application developement. I'll try to learn most out of it.

Things I've used so far
=======================
* ListViews
* SQLite Database Handler
* Context Menu
* CRUD Operations (still in progress)

Further improvements
====================

* Custom ListViews
* Copy to clipboard feature
* Update Note feature
* Delete multiple Notes at a time
* Creating a splash screen
